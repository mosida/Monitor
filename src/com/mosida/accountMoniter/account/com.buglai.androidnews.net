Full of discounts and deals. Was skeptical about the clothing so I decided to just buy some digital goods first, which all turned out to be very nice. Genuine and in working conditions.
Found durable and stylish xiaomi phone case on this site. Hope it has more collection for phone accessories in the future. I enjoyed my first order
A nice app. Read other reviews here are my opinions: 1. Yes the items take some time to arrive but for the price you pay and considering it comes from China, waiting for some weeks seem normal 2. I have ordered many many items from them especially clothing, check the size chart for each individual product. 3. The quality of clothing here is reasonable but I would recommend digital products because I think they all work fine and potentially rule out the possibility for asking for refund or return (then it will take more time).A
Great service all year around, thank you team.
It's like a gift shop where you can see most of the popular items on electronics and clothing. Cheap price.
I looove buying stuff from here! I always receive my items.
So far everything has been of great quality and I have no any issues of not receiving any of my orders.
Having checked various sites for shopping i can say it is offer one of the best value products for digital collection.
Love the app and all the products look great...will keep on checking this app and continue with the app development
Cheap and I don't doubt it! The problem was with a necklace I ordered. Seem to be a bit old but I think it looks fine after cleaning. For the money I spent it's very good value.
I 100% love this app because you can find the most cost-effective stuff for little money and it's just so amazing. Delivery time is longer than other domestic app like flipkart but I don't mind too much about it.
They come very late sometimes, but what do you expect for a product with over 70% off, which could be otherwise overpriced in local stores? Really good selection of cost-effective products and deals are irresitible
Great site and many different catagories to select from. Especially enjoy digital products. Love it
After my first purchase I realise it's a very accessible app. The designers must have thought about how to make it easy for customer to buy great value stuff. The deals are sometimes a bit different to comprehend coz all the rules and conditions. But you will be guaranted with great prices so I think we should not get itimitated by that. Will keep looking at this app.
I'm impressed by the electronics items such as SD card and earphones so they were what I went for last time.
The prices are great yes! It's a good experience when you get so many discounts and various cheap products on one site. But I would want the team to improve on two things. 1) a helpline so i can reach some staff instantly 2) More detailed category division so I can spend less time browsing what I want.
110% addicted to this app. Simply checking the discounted price is addictive! Made a few orders on electronics and already think it's a great place to shop
Lovely place to buy electronics merchandise for home and digital accessories.
I just want to clarify: almost everything shipped from China will take longer time to arrive than orders sourced domestically. Personally I found payment using Paytm very simple and secure. No failed payment or serious delay in delivery.
Haven for sourcing inexpensive gourment and digital items. Love it!
Overall a reasonably good place to shop! Quality may or may not be great, depending on item and seller but as long as you are not looking for expensive goods the quality is alright! Considering the price and it's actually very good bargain.
Possibly the most impressive shopping app for me in a long time. Simple way to shop, no extra thing, just cheap cheap stuff! Love
I got recommended by a friend who is a guru in bargain shopping. Tried to make an order and found out all the dirt cheap stuff here
Accessories are not many found here but you will always be surprised by the prices. Just bear in mind that delivery does take some time.
I don't know why people have so extreme feedback here. 1) Shipping is from China so we shouldn't expect thing to take fast. 2) As long as quality is decent and no damage made, I think it's a handy app. Great
Nice design and better experience. Hope to have better customer service because I sometimes feel there is insufficient enquiry methods.
Quite satisfy! Considering I have used other apps, this has a separate advantage: no worries for delivery coz it's all free. Sure will get more orders later.
Juanpi has been awesome so far to me. Pretty good deals every single day (flash sale) so I keep coming back to it everyday to see what I can quicky buy!
Very cheap THE BEST shopping site for me!
My honest comment is that it is a good place supplementary to other sites like flipkart or amazon because it can help you see how similiar items show different prices!
Good services and helpful answers on facebook, it is a good shopping site. I like Juanpi
No more mistakes made on shopping ever again after this seeing this app.
So eager to get more coupons now. I love this app because it's so awesome and generous in giving me goodies like coupons when I signed up and cheap deals. But I just want to say that I would much prefer a good customer service that can shiftly answer my questions about order questions. No information available!
Keep it up team! Excited to see the deals and offers rolling out gradually. Time for fun and cheap shopping.
Excellent app. Easy to navigate and did my shopping at home!! Please team help fix search (and search history to find previous results) so it becomes easier to use.
Decent quality goods shipped from China. One piece of advice: do not automatically show delivered when I got actually different information when I asked the team.
It may be unfamiliar to many users that have been using other sites but I would say it's pretty reliable. Cheap deals and you can always talk to the team online (although no phone call)
Reliable quality for the bluetooth and SD memory card I ordered - cheap and got extra discount coz it's my first time shopping. Wonderful
Generally no problem. Got my order within 1 week and half. But I was confused by a little error: why show delivered when no received product. It's strange untill got clarified by the team
Been a regular shopper of this app since the beginning. Major improvement are cheerful and would like to see the company introducing more deals - durable and good value!
Can be better - better categorisation of products will make the interface more beautiful. Free shipping is so appealing!
Awesome for zero delivery fee for each item. So far, I didn't have any bad experience using the app! keep it up juanpi
Hope will update more new products especially on daily sale
Very good ecommerce platform! No shipping fee & secure payment paytym gateaway
I have not seen anything glitch so far; shopping made easier here.
Trustworthy shopping site because I have so far no worries over its reliability. Firstly no shipping fee and they courier will always sort out the international delivery problem at the custom. Secondly I think it's very appealing to see the team orgranise various sales, with extra coupons provided in advance! Put a lot effort in it!
Some update (search, tracking information instantly, nicer pics display) will make this app better!
One primary reason for shopping here: cheaper than other apps but I think it's important as well to check specific products. Some dealer offers very nice goods. But it poses another problem. Multiple products do not get grouped in one order because they may not be from the same user.
Goooood app and so cheap across all selection
Perfect gift shop online and keep it up! No shipping fee is the selling point!!
Wonderful place to buy cheap stuff! All the best to team
Bought some orders and the quality are decent. A little delay in delivery but the rest is fine
Just ordered and would like to check out the shirt quality
bought my memory cards for my camera and they work fine. No need to worry about it. Cheap digital collection
Please offer a contect number for me so I can call you for ordering, the rest is fine. Very low prices
Lots of great offers at incredible prices. I love the goods sold on this site. keep it up team!
Invited by the promotion on Holi and I would like to say that the team put much effort into creating this app. I found the flash sale especially appealing, more and more discounts now!
Wish there could be COD option but I think no shipping fee is very attractive.
TEAM please offer a contact number for me so I can order instantly. But I love this app!! So cheap and many different items that are otherwise overpriced in local stores.
Love it! SO many merchandises on this site. I want to buy more now.
There should have been an icon indication to identify a sold item because i see so many of them on flash sale. The rest is good! Love cheap price!!!
Juanpi is the best for anything you want to from a bargain sale. Working just fine!
Bravo!! Unbelievebly low prices and coupons are so easy to get.
Love the daily lucky draw. I didn't win the xiaomi phone but got some coupons for my purchase. Only spent very little money on everything I have bought so far.
Buy everything that's cheap and with decent quality! Lovely app
So far so good! Thumb up to Juanpi Team
100% working and love the cheap prices!
I especially love the daily lucky draw! So much fun while I do my shopping
Best app for international bargain shopping
Downloaded this app during juanpi holi sale and I would say everything works fine! Wonderful
Awesome app for everyone looking for cheap stuff!
Still checking this app and may decide to buy later. I love the design and with Paytm it is looking very convincing.
So cool to see all these cheap deals that are on sale!! Love this app
fantastic products. Got my smartwatch for running! Works fine and very light.
Bluetooth smartwatch is at very cheap price here and I trust the electronics collection here.
Maybe they are not selling the brand products so prices are cheap! But I trust the quality. Nothing disappoingting so far!
Lovely deals! No complaints so far
More than Okay! App with good service. Liked the facebook page.
Awesome ecommerce platform to buy very very cheap garments and electronics. So excited to check out the products all with low prices.
LOVE IT! Had some issues with the delivery though. I gave the app a rating because of it's simplicity and usability.
Fantastic design interface and the better thing about this app is the low price!
So many promotions all the time and I just got addicted to it!
This is a nice app but here's the problem, you have limited options. Would like to have more options!
downloaded the app and from the short period of playing about juanpi, it looks like a useful and reliable site.
Very helpful site! Shopping options all look very nice!
Helpful site. I have been able to find and buy goods through this app.
Great app! Like the notification alert for flash sale so I can get the best price products all the time!
Love everything about this app. Cheap cheap stuff all at lovely price.
ALL-IN-ONE shopping site so I can instantly compare products from another platform. Love it.
Please add more shopping options I can get more cheap deals
Promotions are always attractive and most goods are discounted up to 70%. This is very good price and I would like to make more orders in the future.
Enjoyed the convenience of this app and I would like to have some improvement on search and better commodity sorting. Sometimes I spent too much time looking for one product.
good app but please take some time to fix the search tool. The rest seems good for me. Cheap price and easy payment.
Payment method is secure thats for sure. Please add more collection. I want to have different tiers of product, not just the very cheap one.
Bought my bluetooth speaker and the quality is the same as the more expensive ones. Great channel to buy things.
The app is fantastic. So many cheap stuff for you to buy. Comes handy!!
just so good to use when it comes to bargain shopping.
Life just made easy when I can shopping on here. It gives u lots of choices
Variety is what I look for and this app is doing a good job. Got the best bargains
I love the variety of electronics and accessories this app
So many choices and I always scroll down for a lot time to check out all products!
Can't find another site where things are that cheap!
Love this store so lovely! Great choices
Cute deals all the time! Love it
Please add more products for me to shop. Sometimes I think I couldn't make a decision because I wanted to have more to compare.
This is a great app and it's very easy to use. I got my delivery after 2 weeks so I would say if you don't worry about time then go for it.
Go for this app. It's amazing! So many cheap things around.
5 stars for the design interface and 5 stars for the price. 4 stars for delivery.
One site that brings you variety and low prices. Love all the promotions
I think its good with the quality I received. Got to buy again
Believe it or not. I have saved money since using this app. No more time spent on local stores to waste money there. Juanpi is the answer for you
Great service from juanpi facebook. Ordered and contacted the customer service. Very quick reply for tracking information. But please add this feature in the app. Team
keep it up team! Want to win more contests on facebook and please add products on display.
The site is relatively small in terms of product volume so sometimes things are sold out on flash sale. But the prices are unbeatible! WOW
Love this app because I always tried to look for bargain stores online (to save my time on shopping). Now it's the solution.
Great app , lots of amazing deals, get what you pay for..shipping sometimes takes weeks though...Given that there is no shipping fee, it's okay.
You will get what you pay for on this site because we all know it's free shipping. Products from China will take some time to reach India
The app is very accessible but the site is a little small. There is certainly room for improvement such as in search and product sorting.
The new version brings some new features but still no search?? Love the prices and promotions! Coupons are so easy to get.
So many coupons to use (3 new user coupons can't be used together though) and they can save money! Cheap deals even without the coupons.
Quality is good because each item costs very little!
Wonderful site for bargains. Now I always do my shopping by comparing juanpi and other sites. Good to see many platforms like this growing.
It's great! Loving it and all the good deals are so irresitible!
Didn't notice this site until quite recently. Wonderful prices but they fluctuate though. Free shipping is what I really like about this app.
Enjoyed this site so much. Bought earphones, speaker from here and I just think it's the best app for bargain shopping.
I love the tops here there awesome! So great for Valentine's gifts shopping which helped me choose a smartwatch and necklace!
Simple and convenient! Love the core idea of pay less buy better!
Superb! Nice work by the team which brings so many good products online. Shipping takes 15 days for me though.
For me the point of using this app is making affordable purchases online. Great idea and I really liked the shirts and shorts.
I'm very happy to see this app,as I now can buy easily from overseas. The product quality is decent!
I was a little bit worried about this app because I don't know where the products are from. After making one purchase (a pair of earphone) I think I can trust this site. Nice job.
This is my answer to cheap shopping. I still do shopping on amazon and flipkart but this is a new place for looking unbranded products with great quality!
Payment used to be more complicated and I wasn't sure it's safe. The new verison has go Paytm so I think it's fine! Tried to make an order.
Trusted, I love it. All the product that I bought are working fine.
I like this app. There is a size guide for each item and it gives you great discounts at the time, especially during flash sales.
This is good so far not that i have ordered anything yet. But I will do sure!
I really love all the clothing this app has... I don't need to worry about the sizing because the size chart is provided along with each item. Nice
I love shopping here! I had nothing unplesant but good time since becoming a member here. Got loads of discounts all the time.
I have always loved jaunpi and you can always discover new stuff here! Wonderful.
Love shopping here only thing about the app is without search. But prices are so good!
Bought some clothing products and they all look fine and no problem with the quality.
The order arrives in perfect conditions. Given all the low prices I will order more items next time. Good job by juanpi.
Super cheap, great customer service online, what more can you ask for!
I love juanpi products with extra discounts and the price is awesome!!! Got 3 coupons straight after I signed up!
Great time shopping here and I would say it's the best app for making cost-effective purchases.
No money spent here is a waste because the items are very very cheap!!
Just amazing to see so many cheap items here
I want to get more coupons from juanpi because they are so useful. The prices are already low.
Time to rethink e-commerce after getting this app ready. Delivery is a bit of an issue but the rest is fine. You can't ask for more because it's what you pay that matters.
Simply like it!! Cheap stuff, Great discounts, Decent quality, Excellent services online (track your order status).
I simply loves shopping app! (: I really love Juanpi provided us this great app! I can shop anywhere, as long I have the phone with me!
 As a girl I loves to shop affordable and pretty item! Now got this app, it's very convenient! Navigation is easy and I wish my internet can be faster haha, I wanted shop more! I find that collecting mameq is fun! Searching for it, bid the price become my daily hobbies Loves!

A Happy customer for 2 months Good app! Best deals u will ever get in town. I have purchased numerous items from Juanpi. The app allows me to follow time limit deals everywhere I go.
Buy buy buy I'm check on offers 10x a day thanks to this app.
Juanpi lets me save time and money. Don't we all like that? Plus, all the items that getbshipped from China are very fancy and not easily available anywhere
Awesome. Instead of playing games while waiting, I'm shopping! Some things can't find in Singapore, can find here.

Juanpi has benefitted me alot as products from korea can buy there at a cheaper price by the buyers from korea such products like etude house n many more ! really appreciate the service having this app ♡ anyway also joining the draw for the camera , just to say thanks .
Shopping life is much easier With this app, it allows me skip a few steps to successfully make a purchase. I like the idea that this app allows me increase my shopping productivity, just like what the Singapore government is encouraging all the companies. At the same time, more shopping means more efforts in improving the economy. Let's SHOP more!!!
user-friendly interface, smiliar to using on computer User-friendly interface and useful for doing quick shopping and checking of delivery status. However, I need to use the computer if I want to see the product details on the seller page which could be a little troublesome
Excellent! Fast and efficient though can be lag at times. Just ordered something using this app ^^ (
Excellent and Safe Cost App This app have really help me and my family save cost of item we bought through Juanpi. Rather then buying outside. We save abt minimum 15% to 50% more through this fantastic app. Excellent job guys at Juanpi
Juanpi ♥♥ it is convenient and easy to use! love to use this app to shop when I am in school!
Easy to use Mobile version is so easy to use. And sometimes the promotion is more than using a web version.
Easy app to use! This app is amazing as it allows u to use ur mobile to shop for literally everything in the market. The app layout is easy to use and fun to use. There are always free coupons for us and it always allows us to win prizes. Love it!
Fantastic App. Made my online shopping experience wonderful. It's pretty easy to be used as well. Carting the items that I want and purchasing them all at once. Pricing wise, the items are all affordable and reasonable. Thus everyone should download this app and give it a try.
Beneficial app Very good app so I don't have to use the com or internet explorer. Also it is very interesting to see and all the things I could buy cheaply which is beneficial.
A Very Good App! Juanpi is a very good app to buy all kinds kinds of items. From electronics to clothing the only place I seek for cheap items is definitely Juanpi. Its has everything I need at the cheapest price. Shipping is also quick and low in price. Saves a lot of time. Very fast and easy to purchase clothes for important events. I always browse this app for almost the whole day. Its has everything that I need. There is so many items to purchase and its very interactive.
Superb Apps Superb apps, easy to use & i had already brought some useful and worthy stuff with it.
Juanpi It a very good shopping area that you can get what you want. ;)
Suits my need! Like it and the points, rewards, coupon so rewarding, but must smart utilise it. Still beware of the counterfeit and bad seller.. recommended to use PayPal for payment, easier to claim for dispute cases
Awesome shopping app! This is the best shopping application in Singapore. Makes shopping such a breeze and enjoyable experience [:
great app finally able to purchase lots of things at a low discounted price
Best online shopping Where places u can buy cheaper stuff then retail stores, i love it, thumb up Juanpi!!! Great Apps.
